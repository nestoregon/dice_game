# Planning

I have the "cup" object which should return me the variables.
I have the play object which should be able to evaluate each play
I have the "computer" object which should be able to keep track of the score and make decisions.

For this project I have used the Monte Carlo Simulation. This simulation attempts to find some ground truth behind a huge set of possibilities by randomly generating simulations of a play.
